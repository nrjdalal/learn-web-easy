### Instead of learning traditional CSS, get started with Tailwind CSS.

## How to use Tailwind CSS, as a beginner?

1. Go to the official website of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
2. Click on the "Get Started" button.
3. Under the "Installation" section, choose [Play CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn).

You'll find the following code snippet:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
    Hello world!
  </h1>
</body>
</html>
```
